# AWS S3 Bucket and Lambda Function

These two AWS services pair nicely to build lightweight, serverless workflows. **Amazon S3** provides durable, low-cost object storage for datasets, configs, and artifacts, while **AWS Lambda** runs code on demand (no servers to manage). Together, you can trigger code automatically when files land in a bucket (e.g., data ingestion ‚Üí transform ‚Üí export), expose simple APIs via API Gateway, or schedule recurring tasks‚Äîall with pay-for-what-you-use pricing.

## üîß Components

- **S3 Bucket** ‚Äî stores input/output files (CSV, JSON, images, logs). Can emit events (PUT/DELETE) to trigger Lambda.
- **Lambda Function** ‚Äî small, focused function packaged with dependencies. Invoked by S3 events, API Gateway, EventBridge, or directly.
- *(Optional)* **IAM Roles/Policies**, **CloudWatch Logs**, **EventBridge**, **API Gateway** for permissions, monitoring, scheduling, and HTTP access.

## üöÄ Road followed:

1. **Create an S3 bucket** (unique name, pick a region).  
2. **Write your Lambda** (`handler.py`) that reads/writes to S3.  
3. **Grant permissions** (Lambda execution role with S3 read/write, logs).  
4. **Wire S3 events** (ObjectCreated) to invoke the Lambda.  
5. **Deploy** (SAM/Terraform/Console) and **test** by uploading a file.  
6. **Observe logs** in CloudWatch; iterate on code as needed.
